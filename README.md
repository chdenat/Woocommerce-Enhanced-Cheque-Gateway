# Woocommerce Enhanced Cheque Gateway

This is a beta version (PHP 7.4) of a gateway I built for a customer who want to be paid by cheque, but with the possibility to be paid in 1,2 or more cheques, depending on the amount of the order.

You can describe for each threshold, the number of cheque, ie : under 30â‚¬, 1 cheque only, beetween 30 and 100, 1 or 2 cheques, above 3 cheques..

Number and amounts of cheques are saved in meta with the order.

The checkout confirmation (web part), the email notification and the order saved in the customer account contains information of the payments (cheques, amount of each, date of debit ...) 

Available in French and English.

Please do not hesitate to test, add for enhancement, translate or just comment ...
